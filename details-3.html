        <h2>Cream Cheese Pound Cake</h2>
        <p>Looking for a tasty dessert idea?  Try using cream cheese in place of some of the butter in a pound cake.This Cream Cheese Pound Cake is a fun and unique sweet treat!</p>

        <p>Usually when I pull out butter and cream cheese, it means I'm making a cream cheese frosting.  But not this time.  This time, the butter and cream cheese went into this Cream Cheese Pound Cake. 
            <br> Now I know the thought of using cream cheese in a cake (as opposed to a frosting) might sound a bit odd.  But I can tell ya that it's worth trying!</p>

       <p>The cream cheese adds an extra layer of richness to the pound cake - as if pound cake needed it, right?  I absolutely love pound cakes.  I'd probably put them in my top 5 list of favorite desserts.
        <br>  From store-bought versions to a variety of homemade versions, I've certainly eaten my fair share of pound cake over the years.</p>
        <p>This Cream Cheese Pound Cake is definitely tasty.  I wouldn't say that the cream cheese flavor is super noticeable, but you will notice the overall richness of this cake.  
            <br>It's good.  Like really good.  (It also uses a whole ton of sugar, eggs and butter…so that helps, too!)</p>

        <p>Several years ago, my sister posted a recipe for Cream Cheese Cookies.  Those cookies have become one of the most popular recipes on her blog -and for good reason!  
         <br>   The cream cheese replaces some of the butter in the recipe to yield a fluffy and delicious cookie.  I decided to try the same concept with a pound cake instead.</p>
        <p>As with those cream cheese cookies, I found that using cream cheese in a pound cake yielded a much fluffier cake.  Don't get me wrong - it's still a dense cake.
            It is a pound cake after all! <br> However, as it was baking, this pound cake used every bit of my 12-cup Bundt pan. 
             Had the pan been any smaller, I would've been picking bits of pound cake out of the bottom of my oven.  (That's not high on my list of things to do!)</p>

        <p>I do highly recommend this cake.  I opted for a hefty amount of vanilla extract as the only flavor here…mainly because a good vanilla pound cake is my jam. 
            <br> But I could totally see using a combination of vanilla and almond extract, or perhaps adding a large pinch or two of lemon zest.</p>

        <p>In keeping with the simple approach, I went with a dusting of powdered sugar for the top of this pound cake.  However, a glaze would work well, too.  
           <br> No matter how you serve it, a slice of this cake will be quite tasty!  Oh, and side tip about leftover pound cake.  We enjoyed this cake fresh, but even I can't eat an entire pound cake in 1-2 days.
            <br>You can freeze a portion for later, but if you find yourself with pound cake that's a couple days old?
            Toss a slice into the toaster oven!  The edges will get slightly crispy for a delicious treat.I hope you enjoy this dessert as much as we did!</p>
