     <p>Hello and welcome!  I'm Dat and I believe anyone can learn to confidently make recipes worthy of celebration.</p>
     <p> "I made your pavlova recipe today and it was delicious! As usual, your recipe was easy to follow.
        <br> There's four of us here and there's only one third left.  It'll be gone soon.  Thanks for another great recipe!"</p>
    <p> We tried your weeknight bolognese recipe yesterday!  Ohmygosh, it was so good.  My husband is still talking about it this morning.</p>
    <p> Dat, just wanted to tell you I made your beef stew recipe this weekend.  Just incredible!!  The oven method was perfect and truly brought out the flavors.</p>
    <p> I just wanted to send you a quick email to tell you that I really love your recipes.  I have always loved to cook, but I haven't been much of a baker.
        <br>  I have been baking more and more and I find that your recipes are always the best.</p>
    <p> Imagine your friends and colleagues gobbling up those special treats that you made for them.  Imagine that the dish you made for Thanksgiving or
        <br> those cookies for Christmas are all that anyone is talking about and EVERYONE has asked you for the recipe..</p>
